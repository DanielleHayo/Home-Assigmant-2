                    My name is Danielle Hayo I am currently a third year student in engineering and management at the
                    Rupinn academic center.
                    I have 12 years of schooling with a full matriculation certificate in which I excelled.<br />
                    I enlisted in the army and served in the navy as a duty officer in the main war room and
                    occasionally in
                    an
                    emergency war room. I was released after a full and interesting service.

                    I have been in a relationship with Tal for 6.5 amazing years.
                    I have an amazing family, father, mother and two sisters younger than me. I love spending my time
                    with
                    them.
                    Exercising is an inseparable part of me, I was in floor gymnastics for 7 years as a child and today
                    I
                    train in gyms and Pilates equipment.
                    My hobbies in my free time are traveling in Israel and the world, watching Netflix, listening to
                    songs,
                    fashion, playing snooker, tennis, going out with friends.
